abstract = {Exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared using Hubble/NICMOS is currently ambiguous because different observational groups claim different results from the same data, depending on their analysis methodologies. Spatial scanning with Hubble/WFC3 provides an opportunity to resolve this ambiguity. We here report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets HD209458b and XO-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum photon-collecting efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives the exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly decorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited precision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. Our errors are within 6-percent (XO-1) and 26-percent (HD209458b) of the photon-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than 0.01-percent per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. Our result for XO-1b contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The weak water absorption we measure for HD209458b is reminiscent of the weakness of sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet atmosphere by Charbonneau et al. (2002). Model atmospheres having uniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm{\^{}}2 per gram account approximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in this planet. Our results for HD209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al. (2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission spectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust. However, the extra opacity needed for HD209458b is grayer than for HD189733b, with a weaker Rayleigh component.},

abstract = {In the past five years, deep imaging campaigns conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based observatories have delivered large samples of galaxies at 6.5{\textless}z{\textless}10, providing our first glimpse of the census of star formation activity in what is thought to be the heart of the reionization era. The space density of luminous galaxies has been shown to decrease by 15–20× over 4{\textless}z{\textless}8. Over this same redshift interval, the faint-end slope of the UV luminosity function becomes steeper ($\alpha$≃−2.0 at z≃7−8), revealing a dominant population of low-luminosity galaxies. Analysis of multiwavelength imaging from HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope demonstrates that z{\textgreater}6 UV-selected galaxies are relatively compact with blue UV continuum slopes, low stellar masses, and large specific star formation rates.

abstract = {The super-Earth GJ1214b transits a nearby M dwarf that exhibits 1{\%} intrinsic variability in the near-infrared. Here, we analyze new observations to refine the physical properties of both the star and planet. We present three years of out-of-transit photometric monitoring of the stellar host GJ1214 from the MEarth Observatory and find the rotation period to be long, mostly likely an integer multiple of 53 days, suggesting low levels of magnetic activity and an old age for the system. We show such variability will not pose significant problems to ongoing studies of the planet's atmosphere with transmission spectroscopy. We analyze 2 high-precision transit light curves from ESO's Very Large Telescope along with 7 others from the MEarth and FLWO 1.2 meter telescopes, finding physical parameters for the planet that are consistent with previous work. The VLT light curves show tentative evidence for spot occultations during transit. Using two years of MEarth light curves, we place limits on additional transiting planets around GJ1214 with periods out to the habitable zone of the system. We also improve upon the previous photographic V -band estimate for the star, finding V = 14.71 $\backslash$pm 0.03.},

This is the first brown dwarf atmosphere to have been observed to exhibit metal emission lines as a direct result of intense irradiation.

This is likely an indication that efficient heat redistribution may not be happening on this object, in agreement with models of hot Jupiter atmospheres. The H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} line strength variation shows a strong phase dependency as does the width. We have simulated the Ca II emission lines using a model that includes the brown dwarf Roche geometry and limb darkening and we estimate the mass ratio of the system to be 0.135{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.004. We also apply a gas-phase equilibrium code using a prescribed drift-phoenix model to examine how the chemical composition of the brown dwarf upper atmosphere would change given an outward temperature increase, and discuss the possibility that this would induce a chromosphere above the brown dwarf atmosphere.},

abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

abstract = {The study of exoplanetary atmospheres epitomises a continuous quest for higher accuracy measurements. Systematic effects and noise associated with both the stellar activity and the instrument can bias the results and thus limit the precision of the analysis. To reach a high photometric and spectroscopic precision, it is therefore essential to correct for these effects. We present here a novel non-parametric approach, named Gaussian Process method for Star Characterization (GPSC), to remove effects of stellar activity and instrumental systematics on planetary signals, with a view to preserve the atmospheric contribution which can be as small as 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} or even 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} the flux of the star. We applied our method to data recorded with Kepler, focussing on a sample of lightcurves with different effective temperatures and flux modulations. We found that GPSC can very effectively correct for the short and long term stellar activity and instrumental systematics. Additionally we run the GPSC on both real and simulated transit data, finding transit depths consistent with the original ones. Consequently we considered 10 hours of continuous observations: daily, every other day and weekly, and we used the GPSC to reconstruct the lightcurves. When data are recorded more frequently than once every five days we found that our approach is able to extrapolate the stellar flux at the 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} level compared to the full stellar flux. These results show a great potential of GPSC to isolate the relevant astrophysical signal and achieve the precision needed for the correction of short and long term stellar activity.},

We observed WASP-39b with the 2.12m telescope in the U filter for the first time, and additional observations were carried out in the R and I filters using the 0.84m telescope. WASP-43b was observed in VRI with the same instrument, and in the i filter with the robotic 1.50m telescope. We reduced the data using different pipelines and performed aperture photometry with the help of custom routines, in order to obtain the light curves. The fit of the light curves (1.5--2.5mmag rms), and of the period analysis, allowed a revision of the orbital and physical parameters, revealing for WASP-39b a period ({\$}4.0552947 \backslashpm 9.65 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-7{\}}{\$} days) which is {\$}3.084 \backslashpm 0.774{\$} seconds larger than previously reported.

abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject. Copyright (C) 2000.},

abstract = {We report the analysis of two new spectroscopic observations of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e, in the near infrared, obtained with the WFC3 camera onboard the HST. 55 Cancri e orbits so close to its parent star, that temperatures much higher than 2000 K are expected on its surface. Given the brightness of 55 Cancri, the observations were obtained in scanning mode, adopting a very long scanning length and a very high scanning speed. We use our specialized pipeline to take into account systematics introduced by these observational parameters when coupled with the geometrical distortions of the instrument. We measure the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average relative uncertainty of 22 ppm per visit and find modulations that depart from a straight line model with a 6$\sigma$ confidence level. These results suggest that 55 Cancri e is surrounded by an atmosphere, which is probably hydrogen-rich. Our fully Bayesian spectral retrieval code, T -REx, has identified HCN to be the most likely molecular candidate able to explain the features at 1.42 and 1.54 µm. While additional spectroscopic observations in a broader wavelength range in the infrared will be needed to confirm the HCN detection, we discuss here the implications of such result. Our chemical model, developed with combustion specialists, indicates that relatively high mixing ratios of HCN may be caused by a high C/O ratio. This result suggests this super-Earth is a carbon-rich environment even more exotic than previously thought.},

In order to make possible such a decomposition over single-wavelength data: we generate levels of artificial redundancy, then perform a blind decomposition, calibrate the resulting maps, and lastly measure physical information. We simulate the reduction pipeline using mock data: atmospheric fluctuations, extended astrophysical foregrounds, and point-like sources, but we apply the same methodology to the AzTEC/ASTE survey of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South (GOODS-S). In both applications, our technique robustly decomposes redundant maps into their underlying components, reducing flux bias, improving signal-to-noise, and minimizing information loss. In particular, the GOODS-S survey is decomposed into four independent physical components, one of them is the already known map of point sources, two are atmospheric and systematic foregrounds, and the fourth component is an extended emission that can be interpreted as the confusion background of faint sources.},

abstract = {At the dawn of the first discovery of exoplanets orbiting sun-like stars in the mid-1990s, few believed that observations of exoplanet atmospheres would ever be possible. After the 2002 Hubble Space Telescope detection of a transiting exoplanet atmosphere, many skeptics discounted it as a one-object, one-method success. Nevertheless, the field is now firmly established, with over two dozen exoplanet atmospheres observed today. Hot Jupiters are the type of exoplanet currently most amenable to study. Highlights include: detection of molecular spectral features; observation of day-night temperature gradients; and constraints on vertical atmospheric structure. Atmospheres of giant planets far from their host stars are also being studied with direct imaging. The ultimate exoplanet goal is to answer the enigmatic and ancient question, "Are we alone?" via detection of atmospheric biosignatures. Two exciting prospects are the immediate focus on transiting super Earths orbiting in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs, and ultimately the spaceborne direct imaging of true Earth analogs.},

@article{DeKok2013,
abstract = {Context. After many attempts over more than a decade, high-resolution spectroscopy has recently delivered its first detections of molecular absorption in exoplanet atmospheres, both in transmission and thermal emission spectra. Targeting the combined signal from individual lines in molecular bands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial velocity to separate the planet signal from telluric and stellar contaminants.  Aims: We apply high-resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular absorption in the day-side spectrum of the bright transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733b.  Methods: We observed HD 189733b with the CRIRES high-resolution near-infrared spectograph on the Very Large Telescope during three nights, targeting possible absorption from carbon monoxide, water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide, at 2.0 and 2.3 mum.  Results: We detect a 5-sigma absorption signal from CO at a contrast level of {\~{}}4.5 × 10-4 with respect to the stellar continuum, revealing the planet orbital radial velocity at 154+4-3 km s-1. This allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way as for stellar eclipsing binaries, resulting in 0.846+0.068-0.049M{\&}sun; and Mp = 1.162+0.058-0.039 MJup. No significant absorption is detected from H2O, CO2, or CH4 and we determine upper limits on their line contrasts.  Conclusions: The detection of CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733b can be made consistent with the haze layer proposed to explain the optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum if the layer is optically thin at the normal incidence angles probed by our observations, or if the CO abundance is high enough for the CO absorption to originate from above the haze. Our non-detection of CO2 at 2.0 mum is not inconsistent with the deep CO2 absorption from low-resolution NICMOS secondary eclipse data in the same wavelength range. If genuine, the absorption would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in this wavelength range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory (186.C-0289).},

@article{Shannon1948,
abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

abstract = {The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is currently one of the most widely used instruments for observing exoplanetary atmospheres, especially with the use of the spatial scanning technique. An increasing number of exoplanets have been studied using this technique as it enables the observation of bright targets without saturating the sensitive detectors. In this work we present a new pipeline for analyzing the data obtained with the spatial scanning technique, starting from the raw data provided by the instrument. In addition to commonly used correction techniques, we take into account the geometric distortions of the instrument, whose impact may become important when combined to the scanning process. Our approach can improve the photometric precision for existing data and also push further the limits of the spatial scanning technique, as it allows the analysis of even longer spatial scans. As an application of our method and pipeline, we present the results from a reanalysis of the spatially scanned transit spectrum of HD 209458 b. We calculate the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average relative uncertainty of 40 ppm. We interpret the final spectrum with T-Rex, our fully Bayesian spectral retrieval code, which confirms the presence of water vapor and clouds in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b. The narrow wavelength range limits our ability to disentangle the degeneracies between the fitted atmospheric parameters. Additional data over a broader spectral range are needed to address this issue.},

abstract = {WASP-12b is an extreme hot Jupiter in a 1 day orbit, suffering profound irradiation from its F type host star. The planet is surrounded by a translucent exosphere which overfills the Roche lobe and produces line-blanketing absorption in the near-UV. The planet is losing mass. Another unusual property of the WASP-12 system is that observed chromospheric emission from the star is anomalously low: WASP-12 is an extreme outlier amongst thousands of stars when the log {\$}R{\^{}}{\{}'{\}}{\_}{\{}HK{\}}{\$} chromospheric activity indicator is considered. Occam's razor suggests these two extremely rare properties coincide in this system because they are causally related. The absence of the expected chromospheric emission is attributable to absorption by a diffuse circumstellar gas shroud which surrounds the entire planetary system and fills our line of sight to the chromospherically active regions of the star. This circumstellar gas shroud is probably fed by mass loss from WASP-12b. The orbital eccentricity of WASP-12b is small but may be non-zero. The planet is part of a hierarchical quadruple system; its current orbit is consistent with prior secular dynamical evolution leading to a highly eccentric orbit followed by tidal circularization. When compared with the Galaxy's population of planets, WASP-12b lies on the upper boundary of the sub-Jovian desert in both the {\$}(M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm P{\}}, P){\$} and {\$}(R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm P{\}}, P){\$} planes. Determining the mass loss rate for WASP-12b will illuminate the mechanism(s) responsible for the sub-Jovian desert.},

abstract = {One of the most outstanding issues in exoplanet characterization is understanding the prevalence of obscuring clouds and hazes in their atmospheres. The ability to predict the presence of clouds/hazes a priori is an important goal when faced with limited telescope resources and advancements in atmospheric characterization that rely on the detection of spectroscopic features. As a means to identify favorable targets for future studies with HST and JWST, we use published HST/WFC3 transmission spectra to determine the strength of each planet's water feature, as defined by the H2O - J index. By expressing this parameter in units of atmospheric scale height, we provide a means to efficiently compare the size of spectral features over a physically diverse sample of exoplanets. We find the H2O - J index to be strongly correlated with planet temperature when {\$}T{\_}{\{}eq{\}} {\textless} 750{\^{}}{\{}+90{\}}{\_}{\{}-60{\}}{\$} K and weakly correlated with surface gravity for planets with {\$}\backslashlog g {\textless} 3.2{\^{}}{\{}+0.3{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.2{\}}{\$} dex. Otherwise, the median value of the H2O - J index is {\$}1.8{\{}\backslashpm{\}}0.3{\$} H. Using these two physical parameters, we identify a division between "classes" of exoplanets, such that objects above {\$}T{\_}{\{}eq{\}} = 700{\$} K and {\$}\backslashlog g = 2.8{\$} dex are more likely to have clearer atmospheres with stronger spectral features (H2O - J {\textgreater} 1) and those below at least one of these thresholds are increasingly likely to have predominantly cloudy atmospheres with muted spectral features (H2O - J {\textless} 1). Additional high-precision measurements are needed to corroborate the reported trends.},

abstract = {Infrared transmission and emission spectroscopy of exoplanets, recorded from primary transit and secondary eclipse measurements, indicate the presence of the most abundant carbon and oxygen molecular species (H2O, CH4, CO, and CO2) in a few exoplanets. However, efforts to constrain the molecular abundances to within several orders of magnitude are thwarted by the broad range of degenerate solutions that fit the data. Here we explore, with radiative transfer models and analytical approximations, the nature of the degenerate solution sets resulting from the sparse measurements of "hot Jupiter" exoplanets. As demonstrated with simple analytical expressions, primary transit measurements probe roughly 4 atmospheric scale heights at each wavelength band. Derived mixing ratios from these data are highly sensitive to errors in the radius in planet (at a reference pressure), which are approximately a few percent. For example, an uncertainty of 1{\%} in the radius of a 1000 K and H2-based exoplanet with Jupiter's radius and mass, causes an uncertainty of a factor of {\~{}}100-10000 in the derived gas mixing ratios. The degree of sensitivity depends on how the line strength increases with the optical depth (i.e. the curve of growth) and the atmospheric scale height. Temperature degeneracies in the solutions of the primary transit data, which manifest their effects through scale height and absorption coefficients, are smaller. We argue that these challenges can be partially surmounted by a combination of selected wavelength sampling of optical and IR measurements and, when possible, the joint analysis of transit and secondary eclipse data of exoplanets.},

abstract = {We present MCDA, a modification of the CoRoT detrend algorithm (CDA) suitable to detrend chromatic light curves. By means of robust statistics and better handling of short term variability, the implementation decreases the systematic light curve variations and improves the detection of exoplanets when compared with the original algorithm. All CoRoT chromatic light curves (a total of 65,655) were analysed with our algorithm. Dozens of new transit candidates and all previously known CoRoT exoplanets were rediscovered in those light curves using a box-fitting algorithm. For three of the new cases spectroscopic measurements of the candidates' host stars were retrieved from the ESO Science Archive Facility and used to calculate stellar parameters and, in the best cases, radial velocities. In addition to our improved detrend technique we announce the discovery of a planet that orbits a {\$}0.79{\_}{\{}-0.09{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.08{\}}\backslash,R{\_}\backslashodot{\$} star with a period of {\$}6.71837\backslashpm0.00001{\$} days and has {\$}0.57{\_}{\{}-0.05{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.06{\}}\backslash,R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm J{\}}{\$} and {\$}0.15\backslashpm0.10\backslash,M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm J{\}}{\$}.

@article{Forget2014,
abstract = {What kind of environment may exist on terrestrial planets around other stars? In spite of the lack of direct observations, it may not be premature to speculate on exoplanetary climates, for instance, to optimize future telescopic observations or to assess the probability of habitable worlds. To begin with, climate primarily depends on (i) the atmospheric composition and the volatile inventory; (ii) the incident stellar flux; and (iii) the tidal evolution of the planetary spin, which can notably lock a planet with a permanent night side. The atmospheric composition and mass depends on complex processes, which are difficult to model: origins of volatiles, atmospheric escape, geochemistry, photochemistry, etc. We discuss physical constraints, which can help us to speculate on the possible type of atmosphere, depending on the planet size, its final distance for its star and the star type. Assuming that the atmosphere is known, the possible climates can be explored using global climate models analogous to the ones developed to simulate the Earth as well as the other telluric atmospheres in the solar system. Our experience with Mars, Titan and Venus suggests that realistic climate simulators can be developed by combining components, such as a 'dynamical core', a radiative transfer solver, a parametrization of subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, a thermal ground model and a volatile phase change code. On this basis, we can aspire to build reliable climate predictors for exoplanets. However, whatever the accuracy of the models, predicting the actual climate regime on a specific planet will remain challenging because climate systems are affected by strong positive feedbacks. They can drive planets with very similar forcing and volatile inventory to completely different states. For instance, the coupling among temperature, volatile phase changes and radiative properties results in instabilities, such as runaway glaciations and runaway greenhouse effect.},

@article{Carilli2013,
abstract = {Over the last decade, observations of the cool interstellar medium in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line emission has gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects, to a mainstream tool to study galaxy formation, out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has now been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z{\textgreater}1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z{\~{}}7, highly starforming sub-millimeter galaxies (median redshift z{\~{}}2.5), and increasing samples of 'main-sequence' star forming galaxies at z{\~{}}1.5-2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections, to dynamical imaging at kpc-scale resolution, and multi-line, multi-species studies that determine the physical conditions in the interstellar medium. Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star formation history of the Universe, as they reveal the phase of the interstellar medium that immediately precedes star formation. Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star formation rate density from z{\~{}}0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas to stellar mass ratio in star forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made on determining the CO luminosity to H{\_}2 mass conversion factor at high-z, and the dichotomy between high versus low depletion time values for main sequence versus starburst galaxies, respectively, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical conditions. Studies of atomic fine structure line emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the exceptionally bright [CII] 158 micron line to date. This line is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and has the potential to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic reionization.},

abstract = {Recent surveys have revealed that planets intermediate in size between Earth and Neptune (" super-Earths ") are among the most common planets in the Galaxy 1–3 . Atmospheric stud-ies are the next step toward developing a comprehensive understanding of this new class of object 4–6 . Much effort has been focused on using transmission spectroscopy to character-ize the atmosphere of the super-Earth archetype GJ 1214b 7–17 , but previous observations did not have sufficient precision to distinguish between two interpretations for the atmosphere. The planet's atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavy molecules, such as water (e.g., a 100{\%} water vapor composition), or it could contain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. Here we report a measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b at near-infrared wavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. These data, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorption features from a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. The observed spectrum, however, is featureless. We rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with water-, methane-, carbon monoxide-, nitrogen-, or carbon dioxide-dominated compositions at greater than 5 $\sigma$ confidence. The planet's at-mosphere must contain clouds to be consistent with the data. We observed 15 transits of the planet GJ 1214b with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in-strument on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) between UT 27 September 2012 and 22 August 2013. Each transit observation consisted of four orbits of the telescope, with 45-minute gaps in phase coverage between target visibility periods due to Earth occultation. We obtained time-series spectroscopy from 1.1 to 1.7 µm during each observation. The data were taken in spatial scan mode, which slews the telescope during the exposure and moves the spectrum perpendicular to the dispersion direction on the detector. This mode reduces the instrumental overhead time by a factor of five compared to staring mode observations. We achieved an integration efficiency of 60 – 70{\%}. We extracted the spectra and divided each exposure into five-pixel-wide bins, obtaining spectro-photometric time series in 22 channels (resolution R ≡ $\lambda$/∆$\lambda$ ∼ 70).

abstract = {The data-classification process can possibly involve a huge amount of data in today's cloud computing environment. It could take a long time for processing, and could consume many resources for computation and storage. This study focuses on the problem of using the traditional hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm on a distributed environment since hierarchical agglomerative clustering has high applicability and efficiency. A parallel hierarchical ag-glomerative clustering algorithm is proposed in this study. The proposed algorithm divides the whole computation into several small tasks, distribute the tasks to message-passing processes, and merge the results to form a hierarchical cluster. A threshold is used to reduce the storage requirement during the computation. To evaluate the performance and limitation of our algorithm, this study has conducted several experiments using real astronomical data, the main asteroid belt catalog. The experimental results confirm that the proposed parallel algorithm is efficient.},

abstract = {We present here new transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter HD-189733b using the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We obtained two nights of observations where we recorded the primary transit of the planet in the J-, H- and K-bands simultaneously, covering a spectral range from 0.94 to 2.42 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m. We used Fourier analysis and other de-trending techniques validated previously on other datasets to clean the data. We tested the statistical significance of our results by calculating the auto-correlation function, and we found that, after the detrending, auto-correlative noise is diminished at most frequencies. Additionally, we repeated our analysis on the out-of-transit data only, showing that the residual telluric contamination is well within the error bars. While these techniques are very efficient when multiple nights of observations are combined together, our results prove that even one good night of observations is enough to provide statistically meaningful data. Our observed spectra are consistent with space-based data recorded in the same wavelength interval by multiple instruments, indicating that ground-based facilities are becoming a viable and complementary option to spaceborne observatories. The best fit to the features in our data was obtained with water vapor. Our error bars are not small enough to address the presence of additional molecules, however by combining the information contained in other datasets with our results, it is possible to explain all the available observations with a modelled atmospheric spectrum containing water vapor, methane, carbon monoxide and hazes/clouds.},

abstract = {High-volume feature-rich data sets are becoming the bread-and-butter of 21st century astronomy but present significant challenges to scientific discovery. In particular, identifying scientifically significant relationships between sets of parameters is non-trivial. Similar problems in biological and geosciences have led to the development of systems which can explore large parameter spaces and identify potentially interesting sets of associations. In this paper, we describe the application of automated discovery systems of relationships to astronomical data sets, focusing on an evolutionary programming technique and an information-theory technique. We demonstrate their use with classical astronomical relationships - the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies. We also show how they work with the issue of binary classification which is relevant to the next generation of large synoptic sky surveys, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We find that comparable results to more familiar techniques, such as decision trees, are achievable. Finally, we consider the reality of the relationships discovered and how this can be used for feature selection and extraction.},

abstract = {We present MCDA, a modification of the CoRoT detrend algorithm (CDA) suitable to detrend chromatic light curves. By means of robust statistics and better handling of short term variability, the implementation decreases the systematic light curve variations and improves the detection of exoplanets when compared with the original algorithm. All CoRoT chromatic light curves (a total of 65,655) were analysed with our algorithm. Dozens of new transit candidates and all previously known CoRoT exoplanets were rediscovered in those light curves using a box-fitting algorithm. For three of the new cases spectroscopic measurements of the candidates' host stars were retrieved from the ESO Science Archive Facility and used to calculate stellar parameters and, in the best cases, radial velocities. In addition to our improved detrend technique we announce the discovery of a planet that orbits a {\$}0.79{\_}{\{}-0.09{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.08{\}}\backslash,R{\_}\backslashodot{\$} star with a period of {\$}6.71837\backslashpm0.00001{\$} days and has {\$}0.57{\_}{\{}-0.05{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.06{\}}\backslash,R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm J{\}}{\$} and {\$}0.15\backslashpm0.10\backslash,M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm J{\}}{\$}.

@article{Mancini2013,
abstract = {We present new ground-based, multi-colour, broad-band photometric measurements of the physical parameters, transmission and emission spectra of the transiting extrasolar planet WASP-19b. The measurements are based on observations of 8 transits and four occultations using the 1.5m Danish Telescope, 14 transits at the PEST observatory, and 1 transit observed simultaneously through four optical and three near-infrared filters, using the GROND instrument on the ESO 2.2m telescope. We use these new data to measure refined physical parameters for the system. We find the planet to be more bloated and the system to be twice as old as initially thought. We also used published and archived datasets to study the transit timings, which do not depart from a linear ephemeris. We detected an anomaly in the GROND transit light curve which is compatible with a spot on the photosphere of the parent star. The starspot position, size, spot contrast and temperature were established. Using our new and published measurements, we assembled the planet's transmission spectrum over the 370-2350 nm wavelength range and its emission spectrum over the 750-8000 nm range. By comparing these data to theoretical models we investigated the theoretically-predicted variation of the apparent radius of WASP-19b as a function of wavelength and studied the composition and thermal structure of its atmosphere. We conclude that: there is no evidence for strong optical absorbers at low pressure, supporting the common idea that the planet's atmosphere lacks a dayside inversion; the temperature of the planet is not homogenized, because the high warming of its dayside causes the planet to be more efficient in re-radiating than redistributing energy to the night side; the planet seems to be outside of any current classification scheme.},

We derive closed form expressions for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process, by integrating away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process model. We show surprising equivalences between different hierarchical Gaussian process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive a new sampling scheme for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate these equivalences. Overall, we show that a Student-t process can retain the attractive properties of a Gaussian process -- a nonparametric representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions, and easy model selection through covariance kernels -- but has enhanced flexibility, and predictive covariances that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depend on the values of training observations. We verify empirically that a Student-t process is especially useful in situations where there are changes in covariance structure, or in applications like Bayesian optimization, where accurate predictive covariances are critical for good performance. These advantages come at no additional computational cost over Gaussian processes.},

abstract = {We study the influence of gas metallicity, turbulence, and non-equilibrium chemistry on the evolution of the two-phase interstellar medium (warm and cold atomic phases), and thereby constrain the initial conditions for star formation prevailing in turbulent gas. We perform high-resolution simulations in three dimensions, including a realistic non-equilibrium treatment of the ionization state of the gas, and examine both driven and decaying turbulence. This allows us to explore variations in the metallicity Z. In this paper, we study solar metallicity, Z=Z{\_}sun, and low metallicity, Z=1d-3 Z{\_}sun, gas. For driven, large-scale turbulence, we find that the influence of the metallicity on the amount of mass in the cold gas component is small. However, in decaying turbulent conditions this picture is much changed. While cold regions survive in the case of solar metallicity, they are quickly heated and dispersed in low-metallicity gas. This result suggests that star formation can be suppressed in environments of low metallicity, unless a strong turbulent driver is acting on time scales shorter than a few turbulent crossing times. Inter alia this finding could explain the overall inefficient star formation as well as the burst-like mode of star formation found in metal-poor, gas-rich systems like dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1 consists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of {\~{}}3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of {\~{}}0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of {\~{}}94000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is {\~{}}10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to {\~{}}0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

abstract = {We report the analysis of two new spectroscopic observations of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e, in the near infrared, obtained with the WFC3 camera onboard the HST. 55 Cancri e orbits so close to its parent star, that temperatures much higher than 2000 K are expected on its surface. Given the brightness of 55 Cancri, the observations were obtained in scanning mode, adopting a very long scanning length and a very high scanning speed. We use our specialized pipeline to take into account systematics introduced by these observational parameters when coupled with the geometrical distortions of the instrument. We measure the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average relative uncertainty of 22 ppm per visit and find modulations that depart from a straight line model with a 6{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence level. These results suggest that 55 Cancri e is surrounded by an atmosphere, which is probably hydrogen-rich. Our fully Bayesian spectral retrieval code, T-REx, has identified HCN to be the most likely molecular candidate able to explain the features at 1.42 and 1.54 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. While additional spectroscopic observations in a broader wavelength range in the infrared will be needed to confirm the HCN detection, we discuss here the implications of such result. Our chemical model, developed with combustion specialists, indicates that relatively high mixing ratios of HCN may be caused by a high C/O ratio. This result suggests this super-Earth is a carbon-rich environment even more exotic than previously thought.},

abstract = {The characterisation of ever smaller and fainter extrasolar planets requires an intricate understanding of one's data and the analysis techniques used. Correcting the raw data at the 10{\^{}}-4 level of accuracy in flux is one of the central challenges. This can be difficult for instruments that do not feature a calibration plan for such high precision measurements. Here, it is not always obvious how to de-correlate the data using auxiliary information of the instrument and it becomes paramount to know how well one can disentangle instrument systematics from one's data, given nothing but the data itself. We propose a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, based on the concept of independent component analysis, to de-convolve the systematic noise and all non-Gaussian signals from the desired astrophysical signal. Such a `blind' signal de-mixing is commonly known as the `Cocktail Party problem' in signal-processing. Given multiple simultaneous observations of the same exoplanetary eclipse, as in the case of spectrophotometry, we show that we can often disentangle systematic noise from the original light curve signal without the use of any complementary information of the instrument. In this paper, we explore these signal extraction techniques using simulated data and two data sets observed with the Hubble-NICMOS instrument. Another important application is the de-correlation of the exoplanetary signal from time-correlated stellar variability. Using data obtained by the Kepler mission we show that the desired signal can be de-convolved from the stellar noise using a single time series spanning several eclipse events. Such non-parametric techniques can provide important confirmations of the existent parametric corrections reported in the literature, and their associated results. Additionally they can substantially improve the precision exoplanetary light curve analysis in the future.},

abstract = {We observed a secondary eclipse of WASP-33b quasi-simultaneously in the optical ({\~{}}0.55 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m) and the near-infrared ({\~{}}1.05 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m) using the 2x8.4 m Large Binocular Telescope. WASP-33 is a {\{}$\backslash$delta{\}} Scuti star pulsating with periods comparable to the eclipse duration, making the determination of the eclipse depth challenging. We use previously determined oscillation frequencies to model and remove the pulsation signal from the light curves, isolating the secondary eclipse. The determined eclipse depth is dF = 1.03 +/- 0.34 parts per thousand, corresponding to a brightness temperature of Tb = 3398 +/- 302 K. Combining previously published data with our new measurement we find the equilibrium temperature of WASP-33b to be Tb = 3358 +/- 165 K. We compare all existing eclipse data to a blackbody spectrum, to a carbon-rich non-inverted model and to a solar composition model with an inverted temperature structure. We find that current available data on WASP-33b's atmosphere can be best represented by a simple blackbody emission, without the need for more sophisticated atmospheric models with temperature inversions. Although our data cannot rule out models with or without a temperature inversion, they do confirm a high brightness temperature for the planet at short wavelengths. WASP-33b is one of the hottest exoplanets known till date, and its equilibrium temperature is consistent with rapid reradiation of the absorbed stellar light and a low albedo.},

abstract = {Several observational works have shown the existence of Jupiter-mass planets covering a wide range of semi-major axes around Sun-like stars. We aim to analyse the planetary formation processes around Sun-like stars that host a Jupiter-mass planet at intermediate distances ranging from {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 au to 2 au. Our study focusses on the formation and evolution of terrestrial-like planets and water delivery in the habitable zone (HZ) of the system. Our goal is also to analyse the long-term dynamical stability of the resulting systems. A semi-analytic model was used to define the properties of a protoplanetary disk that produces a Jupiter-mass planet around the snow line, which is located at {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2.7 au for a solar-mass star. Then, it was used to describe the evolution of embryos and planetesimals during the gaseous phase up to the formation of the Jupiter-mass planet, and we used the results as the initial conditions to carry out N-body simulations of planetary accretion. Our simulations produce three different classes of planets in the HZ: 'water worlds', with masses between 2.75 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} and 3.57 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} and water contents of 58{\%} and 75{\%} by mass, terrestrial-like planets, with masses ranging from 0.58 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} to 3.8 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} and water contents less than 1.2{\%} by mass, and 'dry worlds', simulations of which show no water. A relevant result suggests the efficient coexistence in the HZ of a Jupiter-mass planet and a terrestrial-like planet with a percentage of water by mass comparable to the Earth. Moreover, our study indicates that these planetary systems are dynamically stable for at least 1 Gyr. Systems with a Jupiter-mass planet located at 1.5 au - 2 au around solar-type stars are of astrobiological interest. These systems are likely to harbour terrestrial-like planets in the HZ with a wide diversity of water contents.},

abstract = {When we are fortunate enough to view an exoplanetary system nearly edge-on, the star and planet periodically eclipse each other. Observations of eclipses (transits and occultations) provide a bonanza of information that cannot be obtained from radial-velocity data alone, such as the relative dimensions of the planet and its host star, as well as the orientation of the planet's orbit relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis. The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets. This chapter reviews the basic geometry and physics of eclipses, and summarizes the knowledge that has been gained through eclipse observations, as well as the information that might be gained in the future.},

@article{Deming2017,
abstract = {We re-visit the principles of transmission spectroscopy for transiting extrasolar planets, focusing on the overlap between the planetary spectrum and the illuminating stellar spectrum. Virtually all current models of exoplanetary transmission spectra utilize an approximation that is inaccurate when the spectrum of the illuminating star has a complex line structure, such as molecular bands in M-dwarf spectra. In those cases, it is desirable to model the observations using a coupled stellar-planetary radiative transfer model calculated at high spectral resolving power, followed by convolution to the observed resolution. Not consistently accounting for overlap of stellar M-dwarf and planetary lines at high spectral resolution can bias the modeled amplitude of the exoplanetary transmission spectrum, producing modeled absorption that is too strong. We illustrate this bias using the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1b, as observed using HST/WFC3. The bias in this case is about 250 parts-per-million, 12{\%} of the modeled transit absorption. Transit spectroscopy using JWST will have access to longer wavelengths where the water bands are intrinsically stronger, and the observed signal-to-noise ratios will be higher than currently possible. We therefore expect that this resolution-linked bias will be especially important for future JWST observations of TESS-discovered super-Earths and mini Neptunes transiting M-dwarfs.},

abstract = {Prior to star formation, pre-stellar cores accumulate matter towards the centre. As a consequence, their central density increases while the temperature decreases. Understanding the evolution of the chemistry and physics in this early phase is crucial to study the processes governing the formation of a star. We aim at studying the chemical differentiation of a prototypical pre-stellar core, L1544, by detailed molecular maps. In contrast with single pointing observations, we performed a deep study on the dependencies of chemistry on physical and external conditions. We present the emission maps of 39 different molecular transitions belonging to 22 different molecules in the central 6.25 arcmin{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} of L1544. We classified our sample in five families, depending on the location of their emission peaks within the core. Furthermore, to systematically study the correlations among different molecules, we have performed the principal component analysis (PCA) on the integrated emission maps. The PCA allows us to reduce the amount of variables in our dataset. Finally, we compare the maps of the first three principal components with the H{\$}{\_}2{\$} column density map, and the T{\$}{\_}{\{}dust{\}}{\$} map of the core. The results of our qualitative analysis is the classification of the molecules in our dataset in the following groups: (i) the {\$}c{\$}-C{\$}{\_}3{\$}H{\$}{\_}2{\$} family (carbon chain molecules), (ii) the dust peak family (nitrogen-bearing species), (iii) the methanol peak family (oxygen-bearing molecules), (iv) the HNCO peak family (HNCO, propyne and its deuterated isotopologues). Only HC{\$}{\^{}}{\{}18{\}}{\$}O{\$}{\^{}}+{\$} and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}CS do not belong to any of the above mentioned groups. The principal component maps allow us to confirm the (anti-)correlations among different families that were described in a first qualitative analysis, but also points out the correlation that could not be inferred before.},

abstract = {Of the many recently discovered worlds orbiting distant stars, very little is yet known of their chemical composition. With the arrival of new transit spectroscopy and direct imaging facilities, the question of molecular detectability as a function of signal-to-noise (SNR), spectral resolving power and type of planets has become critical. In this paper, we study the detectability of key molecules in the atmospheres of a range of planet types, and report on the minimum detectable abundances at fixed spectral resolving power and SNR. The planet types considered-hot Jupiters, hot super-Earths, warm Neptunes, temperate Jupiters and temperate super-Earths-cover most of the exoplanets characterisable today or in the near future. We focus on key atmospheric molecules, such as CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, H2O, C2H2, C2H6, HCN, H2S and PH3. We use two methods to assess the detectability of these molecules: a simple measurement of the deviation of the signal from the continuum, and an estimate of the level of confidence of a detection through the use of the likelihood ratio test over the whole spectrum (from 1 to 16$\mu$m). We find that for most planetary cases, SNR=5 at resolution R=300 ($\lambda${\textless}5$\mu$m) and R=30 ($\lambda${\textgreater}5$\mu$m) is enough to detect the very strongest spectral features for the most abundant molecules, whereas an SNR comprised between 10 and 20 can reveal most molecules with abundances 10-6 or lower, often at multiple wavelengths. We test the robustness of our results by exploring sensitivity to parameters such as vertical thermal profile, mean molecular weight of the atmosphere and relative water abundances. We find that our main conclusions remain valid except for the most extreme cases. Our analysis shows that the detectability of key molecules in the atmospheres of a variety of exoplanet cases is within realistic reach, even with low SNR and spectral resolving power. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

With this new light curve, in conjunction with stellar evolutionary models, we improve on existing measurements of the planetary, stellar, and orbital parameters. We find a stellar radius R sstarf = 0.698 ± 0.012 R sun and a planetary radius RP = 1.080 ± 0.020 R Jup. The quoted errors do not include any possible systematic errors in the stellar evolutionary models. Our measurement improves the precision of the planet's radius by a factor of 4, and revises the previous estimate downward by 16{\%} (2.5$\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the quadrature sum of the respective confidence limits). Our measured radius of WASP-10b is consistent with previously published theoretical radii for irradiated Jovian planets.

abstract = {Spectroscopy of exoplanetary atmospheres has become a well established method for the characterisation of extrasolar planets. We here present a novel inverse retrieval code for exoplanetary atmospheres. Tau-REx (Tau Retrieval for Exoplanets) is a line-by-line radiative transfer fully Bayesian retrieval framework. It differentiates itself from existing codes in the literature through: 1) the optimised use of molecular line-lists from the ExoMol project; 2) an unbiased atmospheric composition prior selection, through custom built pattern recognition software; 3) the use of two independent algorithms to fully sample the Bayesian likelihood space: nested sampling as well as a more classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach; 4) iterative Bayesian parameter and model selection using the full Bayesian Evidence as well as the Savage-Dickey Ratio for nested models, and 5) the ability to fully map very large parameter spaces through optimal code parallelisation and scalability to cluster computing. In this publication we outline the Tau-REx framework and demonstrate, using a theoretical hot-Jupiter transmission spectrum, the parameter retrieval and model selection. We investigate the impact of Signal-to-Noise and spectral resolution on the retrievability of individual model parameters, both in terms of error bars on the temperature and molecular mixing ratios as well as its effect on the model's global Bayesian evidence.},

abstract = {The search for an inhabited planet, other than our own, is a driver of planetary exploration in our solar system and beyond. Using information from our own planet to inform search strategies allows for a targeted search. It is, however, worth considering some span in the strategy and in a priori expectation. An inhabited Earth-like planet is one that would be similar to Earth in ways that extend beyond having biota. To facilitate analysis, we introduce a metric that extends from zero, for an inhabited planet that is like Earth in all other regards (i.e., zero differences), toward positive or negative values for planets that differ from Earth. The analysis shows how assessment of life potential in our galaxy changes more significantly if we find an inhabited planet that is less Earth-like (i.e., it quantifies how probability assessments improve with deviations from Earth-likeness). Discovering such planets could also provide a test of the strong form of the Gaia hypothesis - a test that has proved difficult using only the Earth as a laboratory. Lastly, we discuss how an Earth2.0 narrative, that has been presented to the public as a search strategy, comes with nostalgia-laden philosophical baggage that does not best serve exploration.},

abstract = {Detection of molecules using infrared spectroscopy probes the conditions and compositions of exoplanet atmospheres. Water (H(2)O), methane (CH(4)), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), and carbon monoxide (CO) have been detected in two hot Jupiters. These previous results relied on space-based telescopes that do not provide spectroscopic capability in the 2.4-5.2 microm spectral region. Here we report ground-based observations of the dayside emission spectrum for HD 189733b between 2.0-2.4 microm and 3.1-4.1 microm, where we find a bright emission feature. Where overlap with space-based instruments exists, our results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements. A feature at approximately 3.25 microm is unexpected and difficult to explain with models that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions at the 1 bar to 1 x 10(-6) bar pressures typically sampled by infrared measurements. The most likely explanation for this feature is that it arises from non-LTE emission from CH(4), similar to what is seen in the atmospheres of planets in our own Solar System. These results suggest that non-LTE effects may need to be considered when interpreting measurements of strongly irradiated exoplanets.},

@article{Santini2013,
abstract = {We use deep Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations in GOODSS, GOODSN and COSMOS to estimate the average dust mass (Mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellar mass (Mstar)-SFR grid. We study the scaling relations between Mdust, Mstar and SFR at z{\textless}=2.5. No clear evolution of Mdust is observed at fixed SFR and Mstar. We find a tight correlation between SFR and Mdust, likely a consequence of the Schmidt-Kennicutt (S-K) law. The Mstar-Mdust correlation observed by previous works flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the SFR. Most of it likely derives from the combination of the Mdust-SFR and Mstar-SFR correlations. We then investigate the gas content as inferred by converting Mdust by assuming that the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. All galaxies in the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same SFR-Mgas relation (integrated S-K law), which broadly agrees with CO-based results for the bulk of the population, despite the completely different approaches. The majority of galaxies at z{\~{}}2 form stars with an efficiency (SFE=SFR/Mgas) {\~{}}5 times higher than at z{\~{}}0. It is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsic redshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. The gas fraction (fgas) decreases with Mstar and increases with SFR, and does not evolve with z at fixed Mstar and SFR. We explain these trends by introducing a universal relation between fgas, Mstar and SFR, non-evolving out to z{\~{}}2.5. Galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. We use the 3D fundamental fgas-Mstar-SFR relation and the redshift evolution of the Main Sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population of galaxies as a function of z and Mstar, and we find evidence a downsizing scenario.},

abstract = {The multi-planetary system HD 106315 was recently found in K2 data . The planets have periods of {\$}P{\_}b \backslashsim9.55{\$} and {\$}P{\_}c \backslashsim 21.06\backslash,{\$}days, and radii of {\$} r{\_}b = 2.44 \backslashpm 0.17\backslash, {\$} and {\$}r{\_}c = 4.35 \backslashpm 0.23\backslash, {\$} {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$}. The brightness of the host star (V=9.0 mag) makes it an excellent target for transmission spectroscopy. However, to interpret transmission spectra it is crucial to measure the planetary masses. We obtained high precision radial velocities for HD{\~{}}106315 to determine the mass of the two transiting planets discovered with Kepler K2. Our successful observation strategy was carefully tailored to mitigate the effect of stellar variability. We modelled the new radial velocity data together with the K2 transit photometry and a new ground-based partial transit of HD 106315c to derive system parameters. We estimate the mass of HD 106315b to be 12.6 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 3.2 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} and the density to be {\$}4.7 \backslashpm 1.7\backslash, g\backslash,cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, while for HD 106315c we estimate a mass of 15.2 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 3.7 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} and a density of {\$}1.01 \backslashpm 0.29\backslash, {\$}g$\backslash$,cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}. Hence, despite planet c having a radius almost twice as large as planet b, their masses are consistent with one another. We conclude that HD 106315c has a thick hydrogen-helium gaseous envelope. A detailed investigation of HD 106315b using a planetary interior model constrains the core mass fraction to be 5-29$\backslash${\%}, and the water mass fraction to be 10-50$\backslash${\%}. An alternative, not considered by our model, is that HD 106315b is composed of a large rocky core with a thick H-He envelope. Transmission spectroscopy of these planets will give insight into their atmospheric compositions and also help constrain their core compositions.},

Firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributions as a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of Spitzer, Herschel, LABOCA, and AzTEC data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objects and strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. We found that the mean intensity of the radiation field {\$}{\textless} U {\textgreater}{\$} heating the dust (strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshift up to z{\$}\backslashsim{\$}4 in main-sequence galaxies. We can reproduce this evolution with simple models that account for the decrease of the gas metallicity with redshift. No evolution of {\$}{\textless} U {\textgreater}{\$} with redshift is found in strong starbursts. We then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as {\$}\backslashrm M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm mol{\}}/(M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm mol{\}}+M{\_}\backslashstar){\$}) with redshift and found a similar, steeply increasing trend for both samples. At z{\$}\backslashsim{\$}4, this fraction reaches {\$}\backslashsim{\$}60{\%}. The average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locus of the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that the bulk of the star formation up to z=4 is dominated by secular processes.},

abstract = {The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) has been used by astronomers for over 30 years as a data interchange and archiving format; FITS files are now handled by a wide range of astronomical software packages. Since the FITS format definition document (the “standard”) was last printed in this journal in 2001, several new features have been developed and standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables, and new world coordinate system conventions which provide a mapping from an element in a data array to a physical coordinate on the sky or within a spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided here in its entirety. In addition to describing the new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were made to the previous version to clarify and reorganize many of the sections. Also included are some appendices which are not formally part of the standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo further evolution, in which case the latest version may be found on the FITS Support Office Web site at {\textless}ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/"{\textgreater}http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}, which also provides many links to FITS-related resources.},

abstract = {Three optical telescopes located at the San Pedro M$\backslash$'artir National Observatory were used for the first time to obtain multi-filter defocused photometry of the transiting extrasolar planets WASP-39b and WASP-43b. We observed WASP-39b with the 2.12m telescope in the U filter for the first time, and additional observations were carried out in the R and I filters using the 0.84m telescope. WASP-43b was observed in VRI with the same instrument, and in the i filter with the robotic 1.50m telescope. We reduced the data using different pipelines and performed aperture photometry with the help of custom routines, in order to obtain the light curves. The fit of the light curves (1.5--2.5mmag rms), and of the period analysis, allowed a revision of the orbital and physical parameters, revealing for WASP-39b a period ({\$}4.0552947 \backslashpm 9.65 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-7{\}}{\$} days) which is {\$}3.084 \backslashpm 0.774{\$} seconds larger than previously reported. Moreover, we find for WASP-43b a planet/star radius ({\$}0.1738 \backslashpm 0.0033{\$}) which is {\$}0.01637 \backslashpm 0.00371{\$} larger in the i filter with respect to previous works, and that should be confirmed with additional observations. Finally, we confirm no evidence of constant period variations in WASP-43b.},

abstract = {The past fifteen years of orbital infrared spectroscopy and in situ exploration have led to a new understanding of the composition and history of Mars. Globally, Mars has a basaltic upper crust with regionally variable quanti-ties of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine associated with distinctive terrains. Enrichments in olivine ({\textgreater}20{\%}) are found around the largest basins and within late Noachian–early Hesperian lavas. Alkali volcanics are also locally present, pointing to regional differences in igneous processes. Many ma-terials from ancient Mars bear the mineralogic fingerprints of interaction with water. Clay minerals, found in exposures of Noachian crust across the globe, preserve widespread evidence for early weathering, hydrothermal, and diagenetic aqueous environments. Noachian and Hesperian sediments include paleolake deposits with clays, carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides that are more localized in extent. The late Hesperian to Amazonian mineralogic record of water is sparser, though sulfates and silica in some locations indi-cate local availability of ground and surface waters even in the most recent geologic epoch.},

abstract = {The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is currently one of the most popular instruments for observing exoplanetary atmospheres, especially with the use of the spatial scanning technique. An increasing number of exoplanets have been studied using this technique as it enables the observation of bright targets without saturating the sensitive detectors. In this work we present a new pipeline for analysing the data obtained with the spatial scanning technique, starting from the raw data provided by the instrument. In addition to commonly used correction techniques, we take into account the geometric distortions of the instrument, whose impact may become important when combined to the scanning process. Our approach can improve the photometric precision for existing data and also push further the limits of the spatial scanning technique, as it allows the analysis of even longer spatial scans. As an application of our method and pipeline, we present the results from a reanalysis of the spatially scanned transit spectrum of HD 209458b. We calculate the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average relative error of 40 ppm. We interpret the final spectrum with T-REx, our line-by-line fully bayesian spectral retrieval code, which confirms the presence of water vapour and investigates the additional presence of NH{\$}{\_}3{\$}, HCN and clouds in the atmosphere of HD 209458b. The narrow wavelength range limits our ability to disentangle the degeneracy between a cloudy atmosphere or a water-poor atmosphere. Additional data over a broader spectral range are needed to address this issue.},

abstract = {Clouds have an important role in the atmospheres of planetary bodies. It is expected that, like all the planetary bodies in our solar system, exoplanet atmospheres will also have substantial cloud coverage, and evidence is mounting for clouds in a number of hot Jupiters. In order to better characterise planetary atmospheres we need to consider the effects these clouds will have on the observed broadband transmission spectra. Here we examine the expected cloud condensate species for hot Jupiter exoplanets and the effects of various grain sizes and distributions on the resultant transmission spectra from the optical to infrared, which can be used as a broad framework when interpreting exoplanet spectra. We note that significant infrared absorption features appear in the computed transmission spectrum, the result of vibrational modes between the key species in each condensate, which can potentially be very constraining. While it may be hard to differentiate between individual condensates in the broad transmission spectra, it may be possible to discern different vibrational bonds, which can distinguish between cloud formation scenarios such as condensate clouds or photochemically generated species. Vibrational mode features are shown to be prominent when the clouds are composed of small sub-micron sized particles and can be associated with an accompanying optical scattering slope. These infrared features have potential implications for future exoplanetary atmosphere studies conducted with JWST, where such vibrational modes distinguishing condensate species can be probed at longer wavelengths.},

abstract = {Prior to star formation, pre-stellar cores accumulate matter towards the centre. As a consequence, their central density increases while the temperature decreases. Understanding the evolution of the chemistry and physics in this early phase is crucial to study the processes governing the formation of a star. We aim at studying the chemical differentiation of a prototypical pre-stellar core, L1544, by detailed molecular maps. In contrast with single pointing observations, we performed a deep study on the dependencies of chemistry on physical and external conditions. We present the emission maps of 39 different molecular transitions belonging to 22 different molecules in the central 6.25 arcmin{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} of L1544. We classified our sample in five families, depending on the location of their emission peaks within the core. Furthermore, to systematically study the correlations among different molecules, we have performed the principal component analysis (PCA) on the integrated emission maps. The PCA allows us to reduce the amount of variables in our dataset. Finally, we compare the maps of the first three principal components with the H{\$}{\_}2{\$} column density map, and the T{\$}{\_}{\{}dust{\}}{\$} map of the core. The results of our qualitative analysis is the classification of the molecules in our dataset in the following groups: (i) the {\$}c{\$}-C{\$}{\_}3{\$}H{\$}{\_}2{\$} family (carbon chain molecules), (ii) the dust peak family (nitrogen-bearing species), (iii) the methanol peak family (oxygen-bearing molecules), (iv) the HNCO peak family (HNCO, propyne and its deuterated isotopologues). Only HC{\$}{\^{}}{\{}18{\}}{\$}O{\$}{\^{}}+{\$} and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}CS do not belong to any of the above mentioned groups. The principal component maps allow us to confirm the (anti-)correlations among different families that were described in a first qualitative analysis, but also points out the correlation that could not be inferred before.},

abstract = {Atmospheres of transiting extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) such as HD 209458 b must impose features on the spectra of their parent stars during transits; these features contain information about the physical conditions and chemical composition of the atmospheres. The most convenient observational index showing these features is the ``spectrum ratio'', defined as the wavelength-dependent ratio of spectra taken in and out of transit. I describe a model that estimates this ratio and its dependence upon parameters of the planetary atmosphere, including its cloud structure, temperature, chemical composition, and wind fields. For giant planets in close orbits, the depths of atomic and molecular features in the spectrum ratio may be as large as 0.001. Observations in visible and near-IR wavelengths using existing and planned spectrographs should be adequate to detect these features, and to provide some diagnostics of the conditions within the planetary atmosphere. I give numerous examples of such diagnostics, and I discuss their practicality.},

@article{Forget2014a,
abstract = {What kind of environment may exist on terrestrial planets around other stars? In spite of the lack of direct observations, it may not be premature to speculate on exoplanetary climates, for instance, to optimize future telescopic observations or to assess the probability of habitable worlds. To begin with, climate primarily depends on (i) the atmospheric composition and the volatile inventory; (ii) the incident stellar flux; and (iii) the tidal evolution of the planetary spin, which can notably lock a planet with a permanent night side. The atmospheric composition and mass depends on complex processes, which are difficult to model: origins of volatiles, atmospheric escape, geochemistry, photochemistry, etc. We discuss physical constraints, which can help us to speculate on the possible type of atmosphere, depending on the planet size, its final distance for its star and the star type. Assuming that the atmosphere is known, the possible climates can be explored using global climate models analogous to the ones developed to simulate the Earth as well as the other telluric atmospheres in the solar system. Our experience with Mars, Titan and Venus suggests that realistic climate simulators can be developed by combining components, such as a 'dynamical core', a radiative transfer solver, a parametrization of subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, a thermal ground model and a volatile phase change code. On this basis, we can aspire to build reliable climate predictors for exoplanets. However, whatever the accuracy of the models, predicting the actual climate regime on a specific planet will remain challenging because climate systems are affected by strong positive feedbacks. They can drive planets with very similar forcing and volatile inventory to completely different states. For instance, the coupling among temperature, volatile phase changes and radiative properties results in instabilities, such as runaway glaciations and runaway greenhouse effect.},

These categories are not always recognized as separate types of approaches in the literature. While there is overlap between some of the theories, models and frameworks, awareness of the differences is important to facilitate the selection of relevant approaches. Most determinant frameworks provide limited “how-to” support for carrying out implementation endeavours since the determinants usually are too generic to provide sufficient detail for guiding an implementation process. And while the relevance of addressing barriers and enablers to translating research into practice is mentioned in many process models, these models do not identify or systematically structure specific determinants associated with implementation success. Furthermore, process models recognize a temporal sequence of implementation endeavours, whereas determinant frameworks do not explicitly take a process perspective of implementation.},

abstract = {Observations of transits of the hot giant exoplanet HD 189733b in the unresolved HI Lyman-alpha line show signs of hydrogen escaping the upper atmosphere of the planet. New resolved Lyman-alpha observations obtained with the STIS spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope in April 2010 and September 2011 confirmed that the planet is evaporating, and furthermore discovered significant temporal variations in the physical conditions of its evaporating atmosphere. Here we present a detailed analysis of the September 2011 observations of HD 189733b, when an atmospheric signature was detected. We present specific methods to find and characterize this absorption signature of escaping hydrogen in the Lyman-alpha line, and to calculate its false-positive probability, found to be 3.6{\%}. Taking advantage of the spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the STIS spectrograph, we also present new results on temporal and spectro-temporal variability of this absorption feature. We also report the observation of HD 189733b in other lines (SiIII at 1206.5A, NV at 1240A). Variations in these lines could be explained either by early occultation by a bow-shock rich in highly ionized species, or by stellar variations.},

abstract = {HD 189733 is an exoplanetary system consisting of a transiting hot Jupiter and an active K2V-type main sequence star. We aim to use VLT/UVES high resolution echelle spectra to study a stellar flare. We have performed simultaneous analyses of the temporal evolution in several chromospheric stellar lines, namely, the Ca II H and K lines, Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta, Hepsilon, the Ca II infrared triplet line, and He I D3. Observations were carried out with a time resolution of approximately 1 min for a duration of four hours, including a complete planetary transit. We determine the energy released during the flare in all studied chromospheric lines combined to be about 8.7e31 erg, which puts this event at the upper end of flare energies observed on the Sun. Our analysis does not reveal any significant delay of the flare peak observed in the Balmer and Ca II H and K lines, although we find a clear difference in the temporal evolution of these lines. The He I D3 shows additional absorption possibly related to the flare event. Based on the flux released in Ca II H and K lines during the flare, we estimate the soft X-ray flux emission to be 7e30 erg. The observed flare can be ranked as a moderate flare on a K-type star and confirms a rather high activity level of HD 189733 host star. The cores of the studied chromospheric lines demonstrate the same behavior and let us study the flare evolution. We demonstrate that the activity of an exoplanet host star can play an important role in the detection of exoplanet atmospheres, since these are frequently discovered as an additional absorption in the line cores. A possible star-planet interaction responsible for a flare occurrence during a transit can neither be confirmed nor ruled out.},

abstract = {Context. We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter HD 189733b, obtained at 3.6 $\mu$m with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from strong systematics, and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on the water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. Aims: We aim at constraining the atmospheric structure and composition of the planet and improving previously derived parameters. Methods: We use a high-S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 $\mu$m. The observation has been performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode. We are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the transit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with transmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations at the same wavelength. Results: We obtained the following system parameters of Rp/R{\_}star = 0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b = 0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and a/R{\_}star = 8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 $\mu$m. These measurements are three times more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they benefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic errors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for stellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration photometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio corrected for the stellar variability agrees with our previous measurement obtained in the same bandpass. We also discuss that water vapour could not be detected by a comparison of the planetary radius measured at 3.6 and 5.8 $\mu$m, because the radius measured at 3.6 $\mu$m is affected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.},

abstract = {We report on the results of the Sun in Time multiwavelength program (X-rays to UV) of solar analogs with ages covering {\~{}}0.1-7 Gyr. The chief science goals are to study the solar magnetic dynamo and to determine the radiative and magnetic properties of the Sun during its evolution across the main sequence. The present paper focuses on the latter goal, which has the ultimate purpose of providing the spectral irradiance evolution of solar-type stars to be used in the study and modeling of planetary atmospheres. The results from the Sun in Time program suggest that the coronal X-ray-EUV emissions of the young main-sequence Sun were {\~{}}100-1000 times stronger than those of the present Sun. Similarly, the transition region and chromospheric FUV-UV emissions of the young Sun are expected to be 20-60 and 10-20 times stronger, respectively, than at present. When we consider the integrated high-energy emission from 1 to 1200 {\~{A}}{\ldots}, the resulting relationship indicates that about 2.5 Gyr ago the solar high-energy flux was about 2.5 times the present value and about 3.5 Gyr ago was about 6 times the present value (when life supposedly arose on Earth). The strong radiation emissions inferred should have had major influences on the thermal structure, photochemistry, and photoionization of planetary atmospheres and have played an important role in the development of primitive life in the solar system. Some examples of the application of the Sun in Time results on exoplanets and on early solar system planets are discussed.},

abstract = {In the last decade, over a million stars were monitored to detect transiting planets. Manual interpretation of potential exoplanet candidates is labor intensive and subject to human error, the results of which are difficult to quantify. Here we present a new method of detecting exoplanet candidates in large planetary search projects which, unlike current methods uses a neural network. Neural networks, also called "deep learning" or "deep nets" are designed to give a computer perception into a specific problem by training it to recognize patterns. Unlike past transit detection algorithms deep nets learn to recognize planet features instead of relying on hand-coded metrics that humans perceive as the most representative. Our convolutional neural network is capable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in noisy time-series data with a greater accuracy than a least-squares method. Deep nets are highly generalizable allowing data to be evaluated from different time series after interpolation without compromising performance. As validated by our deep net analysis of Kepler light curves, we detect periodic transits consistent with the true period without any model fitting. Our study indicates that machine learning will facilitate the characterization of exoplanets in future analysis of large astronomy data sets.},

The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have revealed that exoplanets are very common and extremely diverse in their orbital and bulk properties. We now enter a new era as we begin to investigate the chemical diversity of exoplanets, their atmospheric and interior processes, and their formation conditions. Recent developments in the field have led to unprecedented advancements in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets and the implications for their formation conditions. We review these developments in the present work. We review in detail the theory of atmospheric chemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly irradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant planets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational detections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various types using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and direct imaging. In addition to chemical detections, we discuss the advances in determining chemical abundances in these atmospheres and how such abundances are being used to constrain exoplanetary formation conditions and migration mechanisms. Finally, we review recent theoretical work on the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, followed by a discussion of future outlook of the field.},

abstract = {The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies are shaped by nearly every physical property of the system, including the star formation history, metal content, abundance pattern, dust mass, grain size distribution, star-dust geometry, and interstellar radiation field. The principal goal of stellar population synthesis (SPS) is to extract these variables from observed SEDs. In this review I provide an overview of the SPS technique and discuss what can be reliably measured from galaxy SEDs. Topics include stellar masses, star formation rates and histories, metallicities and abundance patterns, dust properties, and the stellar initial mass function.},

abstract = {The planet HD 209458 b is one of the most well studied hot-Jupiter exoplanets. The upper atmosphere of this planet has been observed through ultraviolet/optical transit observations with H i observation of the exosphere revealing atmospheric escape. At lower altitudes just below the thermosphere, detailed observations of the Na i absorption line has revealed an atmospheric thermal inversion. This thermal structure is rising toward high temperatures at high altitudes, as predicted by models of the thermosphere, and could reach {\~{}} 10 000 K at the exobase level. Here, we report new near ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) observations of atmospheric absorptions during the planetary transit of HD 209458 b. We report absorption in atomic magnesium (Mg i), while no signal has been detected in the lines of singly ionized magnesium (Mg ii). We measure the Mg i atmospheric absorption to be 6.2 ± 2.9{\%} in the velocity range from - 62 to - 19 km s-1. The detection of atomic magnesium in the planetary upper atmosphere at a distance of several planetary radii gives a first view into the transition region between the thermosphere and the exobase, where atmospheric escape takes place. We estimate the electronic densities needed to compensate for the photo-ionization by dielectronic recombination of Mg+ to be in the range of 108-109 cm-3. Our finding is in excellent agreement with model predictions at altitudes of several planetary radii. We observe Mg i atoms escaping the planet, with a maximum radial velocity (in the stellar rest frame) of -60 km s-1. Because magnesium is much heavier than hydrogen, the escape of this species confirms previous studies that the planet's atmosphere is undergoing hydrodynamic escape. We compare our observations to a numerical model that takes the stellar radiation pressure on the Mg i atoms into account. We find that the Mg i atoms must be present at up to {\~{}}7.5 planetari radii altitude and estimate an Mg i escape rate of {\~{}}3 × 107 g s-1. Compared to previous evaluations of the escape rate of H i atoms, this evaluation is compatible with a magnesium abundance roughly solar. A hint of absorption, detected at low level of significance, during the post-transit observations, could be interpreted as a Mg i cometary-like tail. If true, the estimate of the absorption by Mg i would be increased to a higher value of about 8.8 ± 2.1{\%}.},

abstract = {Detailed characterization of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere provides the best hope for distinguishing the makeup of its outer layers, and the only hope for understanding the interplay between initial composition, chemistry, dynamics {\&} circulation, and disequilibrium processes. In recent years, some areas have seen rapid progress while developments in others have come more slowly and/or have been hotly contested. This article gives an observer's perspective on the current understanding of extrasolar planet atmospheres prior to the considerable advances expected from the next generation of observing facilities. Atmospheric processes of both transiting and directly-imaged planets are discussed, including molecular and atomic abundances, cloud properties, thermal structure, and planetary energy budgets. In the future we can expect a continuing and accelerating stream of new discoveries, which will fuel the ongoing exoplanet revolution for many years to come.},

abstract = {We report near-infrared measurements of the terminator region transmission spectrum and dayside emission spectrum of the exoplanet WASP-12b obtained using the HST WFC3 instrument. The disk-average dayside brightness temperature averages about 2900. K, peaking to 3200. K around 1.46. $\mu$m. We modeled a range of atmospheric cases for both the emission and transmission spectrum and confirm the recent finding by Crossfield et al. (Crossfield, I., Barman, T., Hansen, B., Tanaka, I., Kodama, T. [2012b]. arXiv: 1210.4836C) that there is no evidence for C/O {\textgreater} 1 in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. Assuming a physically plausible atmosphere, we find evidence that the presence of a number of molecules is consistent with the data, but the justification for inclusion of these opacity sources based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is marginal. We also find the near-infrared primary eclipse light curve is consistent with small amounts of prolate distortion. As part of the calibration effort for these data, we conducted a detailed study of instrument systematics using 65 orbits of WFC3-IR grims observations. The instrument systematics are dominated by detector-related affects, which vary significantly depending on the detector readout mode. The 256. ×. 256 subarray observations of WASP-12 produced spectral measurements within 15{\%} of the photon-noise limit using a simple calibration approach. Residual systematics are estimated to be ≤70. ppm. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to {\$}\backslashsim N{\^{}}2{\$} for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

abstract = {We report the detection of UCF-1.01, a strong exoplanet candidate with a radius 0.66 ± 0.04 times that of Earth (R ⊕). This sub-Earth-sized planet transits the nearby M-dwarf star GJ 436 with a period of 1.365862 ± 8 × 10-6 days. We also report evidence of a 0.65 ± 0.06 R ⊕ exoplanet candidate (labeled UCF-1.02) orbiting the same star with an undetermined period. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the dimming of light as the planets pass in front of their parent star to assess their sizes and orbital parameters. If confirmed today, UCF-1.01 and UCF-1.02 would be designated GJ 436c and GJ 436d, respectively, and would be part of the first multiple-transiting-planet system outside of the Kepler field. Assuming Earth-like densities of 5.515 g cm-3, we predict both candidates to have similar masses ({\~{}}0.28 Earth-masses, M ⊕, 2.6 Mars-masses) and surface gravities of {\~{}}0.65 g (where g is the gravity on Earth). UCF-1.01's equilibrium temperature (T eq, where emitted and absorbed radiation balance for an equivalent blackbody) is 860 K, making the planet unlikely to harbor life as on Earth. Its weak gravitational field and close proximity to its host star imply that UCF-1.01 is unlikely to have retained its original atmosphere; however, a transient atmosphere is possible if recent impacts or tidal heating were to supply volatiles to the surface. We also present additional observations of GJ 436b during secondary eclipse. The 3.6 $\mu$m light curve shows indications of stellar activity, making a reliable secondary eclipse measurement impossible. A second non-detection at 4.5 $\mu$m supports our previous work in which we find a methane-deficient and carbon monoxide-rich dayside atmosphere.},

abstract = {We present a photometric follow-up of transiting exoplanets HAT-P-3b and TrES-3b, observed by using several optical and near-infrared filters, with four small-class telescopes (D = 36--152cm) in the Northern Hemisphere. Two of the facilities present their first scientific results. New 10 HAT-P-3b light curves and new 26 TrES-3b light curves are reduced and combined by filter in order to improve the quality of the photometry. Combined light curves fitting is carried out independently by using two different analysis packages, allowing the corroboration of the orbital and physical parameters in the literature. Results find no differences in the relative radius with the observing filter. In particular, we report for HAT-P-3b a first estimation of the planet-to-star radius Rp/R* = 0.1112+0.0025-0.0026 in the B band which is coherent with values found in the VRIz'JH filters. Concerning TrES-3b, we derive a value for the orbital period of P = 1.3061862+-0.0000001 days which shows no linear variations over nine years of photometric observations.},

abstract = {Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1 to 1.7 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m). Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.},

We observed one transit of WASP-52b with the low-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The resulting transmission spectrum, covering the wavelength range from 522 nm to 903 nm, is flat and featureless, except for the significant narrow absorption signature at the sodium doublet, which can be explained by an atmosphere in solar composition with clouds at 1 mbar. A cloud-free atmosphere is stringently ruled out. By assessing the absorption depths of sodium in various bin widths, we find that temperature increases towards lower atmospheric pressure levels, with a positive temperature gradient of 0.88 +/- 0.65 K/km, possibly indicative of upper atmospheric heating and a temperature inversion.},

abstract = {Deciphering the role of clouds is central to our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres, as they have a direct impact on the temperature and pressure structure, and observational properties of the planet. Superhot Jupiters occupy a temperature regime similar to low mass Mdwarfs, where minimal cloud condensation is expected. However, observations of exoplanets such as WASP12b (T eq ∼2500 K) result in a transmission spectrum indicative of a cloudy atmosphere. We reexamine the temperature and pressure space occupied by these superhot Jupiter atmospheres, to explore the role of the initial Aland Tibearing condensates as the main source of cloud material. Due to the high temperatures a majority of the more common refractory material is not depleted into deeper layers and would remain in the vapor phase. The lack of depletion into deeper layers means that these materials with relatively low cloud masses can become significant absorbers in the upper atmosphere. We provide condensation curves for the initial Aland Tibearing condensates that may be used to provide quantitative estimates of the effect of metallicity on cloud masses, as planets with metalrich hosts potentially form more opaque clouds because more mass is available for condensation. Increased metallicity also pushes the point of condensation to hotter, deeper layers in the planetary atmosphere further increasing the density of the cloud. We suggest that planets around metalrich hosts are more likely to have thick refractory clouds, and discuss the implication on the observed spectra of WASP12b.},

abstract = {The hot Jupiter HD 189733b is the most extensively observed exoplanet. Its atmosphere has been detected and characterized in transmission and eclipse spectroscopy, and its phase curve measured at several wavelengths. This paper brings together the results of our campaign to obtain the complete transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of this planet from UV to infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope, using the STIS, ACS and WFC3 instruments. We provide a new tabulation of the transmission spectrum across the entire visible and infrared range. The radius ratio in each wavelength band was re-derived, where necessary, to ensure a consistent treatment of the bulk transit parameters and stellar limb darkening. Special care was taken to correct for, and derive realistic estimates of the uncertainties due to, both occulted and unocculted star spots. The combined spectrum is very different from the predictions of cloud-free models for hot Jupiters: it is dominated by Rayleigh scattering over the whole visible and near-infrared range, the only detected features being narrow sodium and potassium lines. We interpret this as the signature of a haze of condensate grains extending over at least five scaleheights. We show that a dust-dominated atmosphere could also explain several puzzling features of the emission spectrum and phase curves, including the large amplitude of the phase curve at 3.6 $\mu$m, the small hotspot longitude shift and the hot mid-infrared emission spectrum. We discuss possible compositions and derive some first-order estimates for the properties of the putative condensate haze/clouds. We finish by speculating that the dichotomy between the two observationally defined classes of hot Jupiter atmospheres, of which HD 189733b and HD 209458b are the prototypes, might not be whether they possess a temperature inversion, but whether they are clear or dusty. We also consider the possibility of a continuum of cloud properties between hot Jupiters, young Jupiters and L-type brown dwarfs.},

After reprocessing the data collected during the first DES-SN observing season (Sep. 2013 through Feb. 2014) using the algorithm, the number of transient candidates eligible for human scanning decreased by a factor of 13.4, while only 1 percent of the artificial Type Ia supernovae (SNe) injected into search images to monitor survey efficiency were lost, most of which were very faint events. Here we characterize the algorithm's performance in detail, and we discuss how it can inform pipeline design decisions for future time-domain imaging surveys, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Zwicky Transient Facility.},

abstract = {Precise atmospheric observations have been made for a growing sample of warm Neptunes. Here we investigate the correlations between these observations and a large number of system parameters to show that, at 95{\%} confidence, the amplitude of a warm Neptune's spectral features in transmission scales roughly with either its equilibrium temperature (T{\_}eq) or its bulk H/He mass fraction (f{\_}HHe). These correlations could indicate either more optically-thick, photochemically-produced hazes at lower T{\_}eq and/or higher-metallicity atmospheres for planets with smaller radii and lower f{\_}HHe. We derive an analytic relation to estimate the observing time needed with JWST/NIRISS to confidently distinguish a nominal gas giant's transmission spectrum from a flat line. Using this tool, we show that these possible atmospheric trends could reduce the number of expected TESS planets accessible to JWST spectroscopy by up to a factor of eight. Additional observations of a larger sample of planets are required to confirm these trends in atmospheric properties as a function of planet or system quantities. If these trends can be confidently identified, the community will be well-positioned to prioritize new targets for atmospheric study and eventually break the complex degeneracies between atmospheric chemistry, composition, and cloud properties.},

WASP-33 is a $\delta$ Scuti star pulsating with periods comparable to the eclipse duration, making the determination of the eclipse depth challenging. We use previously determined oscillation frequencies to model and remove the pulsation signal from the light curves, isolating the secondary eclipse. The determined eclipse depth is $\Delta$F = 1.03 ± 0.34 parts per thousand, corresponding to a brightness temperature of TB = 3398 ± 302 K. Combining previously published data with our new measurement we find the equilibrium temperature of WASP-33 b to be TB = 3358 ± 165 K. We compare all existing eclipse data to a blackbody spectrum, to a carbon-rich non-inverted model and to a solar composition model with an inverted temperature structure. We find that current available data on WASP-33 b's atmosphere can be best represented by a simple blackbody emission, without the need for more sophisticated atmospheric models with temperature inversions. Although our data cannot rule out models with or without a temperature inversion, they do confirm a high brightness temperature for the planet at short wavelengths. WASP-33 b is one of the hottest exoplanets known till date, and its equilibrium temperature is consistent with rapid reradiation of the absorbed stellar light and a low albedo.

abstract = {Terrestrial planets in the solar system, such as the Earth, are oxygen-rich, with silicates and iron being the most common minerals in their interiors. However, the true chemical diversity of rocky planets orbiting other stars is yet unknown. Mass and radius measurements are used to constrain the interior compositions of super-Earths (exoplanets with masses of 1 - 10 Earth masses), and are typically interpreted with planetary interior models that assume Earth-centric oxygen-rich compositions. Using such models, the super-Earth 55 Cancri e (mass of 8 Earth masses, radius of 2 Earth radii) has been suggested to bear an interior composition consisting of Fe, silicates, and an envelope ({\textgreater}= 10{\%} by mass) of super-critical water. We report that the mass and radius of 55 Cancri e can also be explained by a carbon-rich solid interior made of Fe, C, SiC, and/or silicates and without a volatile envelope. While the data allow Fe mass fractions of up to 40{\%}, a wide range of C, SiC and/or silicate mass fractions are possible. A carbon-rich 55 Cancri e is also plausible if its protoplanetary disk bore the same composition as its host star, which has been reported to be carbon-rich. However, more precise estimates of the stellar elemental abundances and observations of the planetary atmosphere are required to further constrain its interior composition. The possibility of a C-rich interior in 55 Cancri e opens a new regime of geochemistry and geophysics in extraterrestrial rocky planets, compared to terrestrial planets in the solar system.},

All of these objects suggest a similar calibration, strongly supporting the view that the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust emission can be used as an accurate and very fast probe of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies. We present ALMA Cycle 0 observations of the Band 7 (350 GHz) dust emission in 107 galaxies from z = 0.2 to 2.5. Three samples of galaxies with a total of 101 galaxies were stellar-mass-selected from COSMOS to have M * {\~{}}= 1011 M ⊙: 37 at z {\~{}} 0.4, 33 at z {\~{}} 0.9, and 31 at z = 2. A fourth sample with six infrared-luminous galaxies at z = 2 was observed for comparison with the purely mass-selected samples. From the fluxes detected in the stacked images for each sample, we find that the ISM content has decreased by a factor {\~{}}6 from 1 to 2 × 1010 M ⊙ at both z = 2 and 0.9 down to {\~{}}2 × 109 M ⊙ at z = 0.4. The infrared-luminous sample at z = 2 shows a further {\~{}}4 times increase in M ISM compared with the equivalent non-infrared-bright sample at the same redshift. The gas mass fractions are {\~{}}2{\%} ± 0.5{\%}, 12{\%} ± 3{\%}, 14{\%} ± 2{\%}, and 53{\%} ± 3{\%} for the four subsamples (z = 0.4, 0.9, and 2 and infrared-bright galaxies).},

abstract = {Context: Accurate measurements of diameters of trans-Neptunian objects are extremely complicated to obtain. Thermal modeling can provide good results, but accurate absolute magnitudes are needed to constrain the thermal models and derive diameters and geometric albedos. The absolute magnitude, Hv, is defined as the magnitude of the object reduced to unit helio- and geocentric distances and a zero solar phase angle and is determined using phase curves. Phase coefficients can also be obtained from phase curves. These are related to surface properties, yet not many are known. Aims: Our objective is to measure accurate V band absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients for a sample of trans-Neptunian objects, many of which have been observed, and modeled, within the 'TNOs are cool' program, one of Herschel Space Observatory key projects. Methods: We observed 56 objects using the V and R filters. These data, along with those available in the literature, were used to obtain phase curves and measure V band absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients by assuming a linear trend of the phase curves and considering magnitude variability due to rotational light-curve. Results: We obtained 237 new magnitudes for the 56 objects, six of them with no reported previous measurements. Including the data from the literature we report a total of 110 absolute magnitudes with their respective phase coefficients. The average value of Hv is 6.39, bracketed by a minimum of 14.60 and a maximum of -1.12. In the case of the phase coefficients we report 0.10 mag per degree as the median value and a very large dispersion, ranging from -0.88 up tp 1.35 mag per degree.},

abstract = {The upper atmospheres of the planets and their satellites are more directly exposed to sunlight and solar-wind particles than the surface or the deeper atmospheric layers. At the altitudes where the associated energy is deposited, the atmospheres may become ionized and are referred to as ionospheres. The details of the photon and particle interactions with the upper atmosphere depend strongly on whether the object has an intrinsic magnetic field that may channel the precipitating particles into the atmosphere or drive the atmospheric gas out to space. Important implications of these interactions include atmospheric loss over diverse timescales, photochemistry, and the formation of aerosols, which affect the evolution, composition, and remote sensing of the planets (satellites). The upper atmosphere connects the planet (satellite) bulk composition to the near-planet (-satellite) environment. Understanding the relevant physics and chemistry provides insight to the past and future conditions of these objects, which is critical for understanding their evolution. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of upper atmospheres and ionospheres in our solar system and discusses aspects of their neutral and ion composition, wind dynamics, and energy budget. This knowledge is key to putting in context the observations of upper atmospheres and haze on exoplanets and to devise a theory that explains exoplanet demographics.},

The SED modelling of the two sources confirms previous findings, based on stacked ensembles, of an increasing mean radiation field {\textless}U{\textgreater} with redshift, consistent with a rapidly decreasing gas metallicity in z {\textgreater} 2 galaxies. Complementing our study with CO[3-2] emission line observations, we measure the molecular gas mass (M{\_}H2) reservoir of the systems using three independent approaches: 1) CO line observations, 2) the dust to gas mass ratio vs metallicity relation and 3) a single band, dust emission flux on the Rayleigh-Jeans side of the SED. All techniques return consistent M{\_}H2 estimates within a factor of {\~{}}2 or less, yielding gas depletion time-scales (tau{\_}dep {\~{}} 0.35 Gyrs) and gas-to-stellar mass ratios (M{\_}H2/M* {\~{}} 0.5-1) for our z{\~{}}3 massive MS galaxies.

abstract = {We present an unsupervised machine learning technique that automatically segments and labels galaxies in astronomical imaging surveys using only pixel data. Distinct from previous unsupervised machine learning approaches used in astronomy we use no pre-selection or pre-filtering of target galaxy type to identify galaxies that are similar. We demonstrate the technique on the HST Frontier Fields. By training the algorithm using galaxies from one field (Abell 2744) and applying the result to another (MACS0416.1-2403), we show how the algorithm can cleanly separate early and late type galaxies without any form of pre-directed training for what an 'early' or 'late' type galaxy is. We then apply the technique to the HST CANDELS fields, creating a catalogue of approximately 60,000 classifications. We show how the automatic classification groups galaxies of similar morphological (and photometric) type, and make the classifications public via a catalogue, a visual catalogue and galaxy similarity search. We compare the CANDELS machine-based classifications to human-based classifications from the Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS project. Although there is not a direct mapping between Galaxy Zoo and our hierarchical labelling, we demonstrate a good level of concordance between human and machine classifications. Finally, we show how the technique can be used to identify rarer objects and present new lensed galaxy candidates from the CANDELS imaging.},

on the planet's primordial origins because water ice is expected to play
an important role in the core accretion model of planet formation.
However, the water content of the solar system giant planets is not well
known because water is sequestered in clouds deep in their atmospheres.
By contrast, short-period exoplanets have such high temperatures that
their atmospheres have water in the gas phase, making it possible to
measure the water abundance for these objects. We present a precise
determination of the water abundance in the atmosphere of the 2 M-Jup
short-period exoplanet WASP-43b based on thermal emission and
transmission spectroscopy measurements obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope. We find the water content is consistent with the value
expected in a solar composition gas at planetary temperatures (0.4-3.5x
solar at 1 sigma confidence). The metallicity of WASP-43b's atmosphere
suggested by this result extends the trend observed in the solar system
of lower metal enrichment for higher planet masses.},

abstract = {Context. Galaxies are strongly influenced by their environment. Quantifying the galaxy density is a difficult but critical step in study- ing the properties of galaxies. Aims. We aim to determine differences in density estimation methods and their applicability in astronomical problems. We study the performance of four density estimation techniques: k-nearest neighbors (kNN), adaptive Gaussian kernel density estimation (DEDICA), a special case of adaptive Epanechnikov kernel density estimation (MBE), and the Delaunay tessellation field estima- tor (DTFE). Methods. The density estimators are applied to six artificial datasets and on three astronomical datasets, the Millennium Simulation and two samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compare the performance of the methods in two ways: first, by measuring the integrated squared error and Kullback-Leibler divergence of each of the methods with the parametric densities of the datasets (in case of the artificial datasets); second, by examining the applicability of the densities to study the properties of galaxies in relation to their environment (for the SDSS datasets). Results. The adaptive kernel based methods, especially MBE, perform better than the other methods in terms of calculating the den- sity properly and have stronger predictive power in astronomical use cases. Conclusions. We recommend the modified Breiman estimator as a fast and reliable method to quantify the environment of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a photometric follow-up of transiting exoplanets HAT-P-3b and TrES-3b, observed by using several optical and near-infrared filters, with four small-class telescopes (D = 36--152cm) in the Northern Hemisphere. Two of the facilities present their first scientific results. New 10 HAT-P-3b light curves and new 26 TrES-3b light curves are reduced and combined by filter in order to improve the quality of the photometry. Combined light curves fitting is carried out independently by using two different analysis packages, allowing the corroboration of the orbital and physical parameters in the literature. Results find no differences in the relative radius with the observing filter. In particular, we report for HAT-P-3b a first estimation of the planet-to-star radius Rp/R* = 0.1112+0.0025-0.0026 in the B band which is coherent with values found in the VRIz'JH filters. Concerning TrES-3b, we derive a value for the orbital period of P = 1.3061862+-0.0000001 days which shows no linear variations over nine years of photometric observations.},

abstract = {We analyzed four Spitzer/IRAC observations at 3.6 and 4.5 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m of the primary transit of the exoplanet GJ436b, by using blind source separation techniques. These observations are important to investigate the atmospheric composition of the planet GJ436b. Previous analyses claimed strong inter-epoch variations of the transit parameters due to stellar variability, casting doubts on the possibility to extract conclusively an atmospheric signal; those analyses also reported discrepant results, hence the necessity of this reanalysis. The method we used has been proposed in Morello et al. (2014) to analyze 3.6 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m transit light-curves of the hot Jupiter HD189733b; it performes an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on a set of pixel-light-curves, i.e. time series read by individual pixels, from the same photometric observation. Our method only assumes the independence of instrumental and astrophysical signals, and therefore guarantees a higher degree of objectivity compared to parametric detrending techniques published in the literature. The datasets we analyzed in this paper represent a more challenging test compared to the previous ones. Contrary to previous results reported in the literature, our results (1) do not support any detectable inter-epoch variations of orbital and stellar parameters, (2) are photometrically stable at the level 10e-4 in the IR, and (3) the transit depth measurements at the two wavelengths are consistent within 1{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}. We also (4) detect a possible transit duration variation (TDV) of 80 s (2 {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} significance level), that has not been pointed out in the literature, and (5) confirm no transit timing variations (TTVs) {\textgreater}30 s.},

abstract = {We present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In order to exploit the over 100 million stellar objects with r {\textless} 22.5 mag observed by SDSS, we need to understand the characteristics of stars in the SDSS ugriz filters. While star clusters provide important calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globular clusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded for the standard SDSS photometric pipeline to process. To complement the SDSS imaging survey, we reduce the SDSS imaging data for crowded cluster fields using the DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME suite of programs and present photometry for 17 globular clusters and three open clusters in a SDSS value-added catalog. Our photometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native SDSS 2.5 m ugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied to the SDSS photometry without relying on any transformations. Model photometry for red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by Girardi et al. cannot be matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by {\~{}}0.02-0.05 mag. Good agreement ( {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {\{}lesssim{\}} 0.02 mag in colors) is found with Clem et al. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformation equations in Tucker et al.},

abstract = {Understanding a planet's atmosphere is a necessary condition for understanding not only the planet itself, but also its formation, structure, evolution, and habitability. This requirement puts a premium on obtaining spectra and developing credible interpretative tools with which to retrieve vital planetary information. However, for exoplanets, these twin goals are far from being realized. In this paper, I provide a personal perspective on exoplanet theory and remote sensing via photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy. Although not a review in any sense, this paper highlights the limitations in our knowledge of compositions, thermal profiles, and the effects of stellar irradiation, focusing on, but not restricted to, transiting giant planets. I suggest that the true function of the recent past of exoplanet atmospheric research has been not to constrain planet properties for all time, but to train a new generation of scientists who, by rapid trial and error, are fast establishing a solid future foundation for a robust science of exoplanets.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a uniform analysis of eight transits and eleven secondary eclipses of the extrasolar planet GJ 436b obtained in the 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 micron bands using the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope between UT 2007 June 29 and UT 2009 Feb 4. We find that the best-fit transit depths for visits in the same bandpass can vary by as much as 8{\%} of the total (4.7 sigma significance) from one epoch to the next. Although we cannot entirely rule out residual detector effects or a time-varying, high-altitude cloud layer in the planet's atmosphere as the cause of these variations, we consider the occultation of active regions on the star in a subset of the transit observations to be the most likely explanation. We reconcile the presence of magnetically active regions with the lack of significant visible or infrared flux variations from the star by proposing that the star's spin axis is tilted with respect to our line of sight, and that the planet's orbit is therefore likely to be misaligned. These observations serve to illustrate the challenges associated with transmission spectroscopy of planets orbiting late-type stars; we expect that other systems, such as GJ 1214, may display comparably variable transit depths. Our measured 8 micron secondary eclipse depths are consistent with a constant value, and we place a 1 sigma upper limit of 17{\%} on changes in the planet's dayside flux in this band. Averaging over the eleven visits gives us an improved estimate of 0.0452{\%} +/- 0.0027{\%} for the secondary eclipse depth. We combine timing information from our observations with previously published data to produce a refined orbital ephemeris, and determine that the best-fit transit and eclipse times are consistent with a constant orbital period.

abstract = {The data-classification process can possibly involve a huge amount of data in today's cloud computing environment. It could take a long time for processing, and could consume many resources for computation and storage. This study focuses on the problem of using the traditional hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm on a distributed environment since hierarchical agglomerative clustering has high applicability and efficiency. A parallel hierarchical ag-glomerative clustering algorithm is proposed in this study. The proposed algorithm divides the whole computation into several small tasks, distribute the tasks to message-passing processes, and merge the results to form a hierarchical cluster. A threshold is used to reduce the storage requirement during the computation. To evaluate the performance and limitation of our algorithm, this study has conducted several experiments using real astronomical data, the main asteroid belt catalog. The experimental results confirm that the proposed parallel algorithm is efficient.},

abstract = {A geometrical pattern is a set of points with all pairwise distances (or, more generally, relative distances) specified. Finding matches to such patterns has applications to spatial data in seismic, astronomical, and transportation contexts. For example, a particularly interesting geometric pattern in astronomy is the Einstein cross, which is an astronomical phenomenon in which a single quasar is observed as four distinct sky objects (due to gravitational lensing) when captured by earth telescopes. Finding such crosses, as well as other geometric patterns, is a challenging problem as the potential number of sets of elements that compose shapes is exponentially large in the size of the dataset and the pattern. In this paper, we denote geometric patterns as constellation queries and propose algorithms to find them in large data applications. Our methods combine quadtrees, matrix multiplication, and unindexed join processing to discover sets of points that match a geometric pattern within some additive factor on the pairwise distances. Our distributed experiments show that the choice of composition algorithm (matrix multiplication or nested loops) depends on the freedom introduced in the query geometry through the distance additive factor. Three clearly identified blocks of threshold values guide the choice of the best composition algorithm. Finally, solving the problem for relative distances requires a novel continuous-to-discrete transformation. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to investigate constellation queries at scale.},

abstract = {We present the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) optical transmission spectroscopy of the cool Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from 0.29-1.025 $\mu$m, along with complementary transit observations from Spitzer IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. The low density and large atmospheric pressure scale height of WASP-39b make it particularly amenable to atmospheric characterization using this technique. We detect a Rayleigh scattering slope as well as sodium and potassium absorption features; this is the first exoplanet in which both alkali features are clearly detected with the extended wings predicted by cloud-free atmosphere models. The full transmission spectrum is well matched by a clear H2-dominated atmosphere, or one containing a weak contribution from haze, in good agreement with the preliminary reduction of these data presented in Sing et al. WASP-39b is predicted to have a pressure-temperature profile comparable to that of HD 189733b and WASP-6b, making it one of the coolest transiting gas giants observed in our HST STIS survey. Despite this similarity, WASP-39b appears to be largely cloud-free, while the transmission spectra of HD 189733b and WASP-6b both indicate the presence of high altitude clouds or hazes. These observations further emphasize the surprising diversity of cloudy and cloud-free gas giant planets in short-period orbits and the corresponding challenges associated with developing predictive cloud models for these atmospheres.},

abstract = {The transiting hot Jupiter XO-2b is an ideal target for multi-object photometry and spectroscopy as it has a relatively bright ({\$}V{\$}-mag = 11.25) K0V host star (XO-2N) and a large planet-to-star contrast ratio (R{\$}{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\$}/R{\$}{\_}{\{}s{\}}\backslashapprox0.015{\$}). It also has a nearby (31.21") binary stellar companion (XO-2S) of nearly the same brightness ({\$}V{\$}-mag = 11.20) and spectral type (G9V), allowing for the characterization and removal of shared systematic errors (e.g., airmass brightness variations). We have therefore conducted a multiyear (2012--2015) study of XO-2b with the University of Arizona's 61" (1.55{\~{}}m) Kuiper Telescope and Mont4k CCD in the Bessel U and Harris B photometric passbands to measure its Rayleigh scattering slope to place upper limits on the pressure-dependent radius at, e.g., 10{\~{}}bar. Such measurements are needed to constrain its derived molecular abundances from primary transit observations. We have also been monitoring XO-2N since the 2013--2014 winter season with Tennessee State University's Celestron-14 (0.36{\~{}}m) automated imaging telescope to investigate stellar variability, which could affect XO-2b's transit depth. Our observations indicate that XO-2N is variable, potentially due to {\{}cool star{\}} spots, {\{}with a peak-to-peak amplitude of {\$}0.0049 \backslashpm 0.0007{\$}{\~{}}R-mag and a period of {\$}29.89 \backslashpm 0.16{\$}{\~{}}days for the 2013--2014 observing season and a peak-to-peak amplitude of {\$}0.0035 \backslashpm 0.0007{\$}{\~{}}R-mag and {\$}27.34 \backslashpm 0.21{\$}{\~{}}day period for the 2014--2015 observing season.

This study demonstrates that long-term monitoring programs of exoplanet host stars are crucial for understanding host star variability.},

By combining the light-curve analysis with theoretical isochrones to determine the stellar properties, we find the planetary radius to be 0.996 +0.031/-0.018 rjup and the planetary mass to be 0.565 +/- 0.054 mjup. These results are consistent with those reported previously, and are also consistent with theoretical models for gas giant planets. The mid-transit times are accurate to within 1 min and are consistent with a constant period. However, the period we derive differs by 2.5 sigma from the previously published period. More data are needed to tell whether the period is actually variable (as it would be in the presence of an additional body) or if the timing errors have been underestimated.},

In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {We examine the history of the loss and replenishment of the Martian atmosphere using elemental and isotopic compositions of nitrogen and noble gases. The evolution of the atmosphere is calculated by taking into consideration various processes: impact erosion and replenishment by asteroids and comets, atmospheric escape induced by solar radiation and wind, volcanic degassing, and gas deposition by interplanetary dust particles. Our model reproduces the elemental and isotopic compositions of N and noble gases (except for Xe) in the Martian atmosphere, as inferred from exploration missions and analyses of Martian meteorites. Other processes such as ionization-induced fractionation, which are not included in our model, are likely to make a large contribution in producing the current Xe isotope composition. Since intense impacts during the heavy bombardment period greatly affect the atmospheric mass, the atmospheric pressure evolves stochastically. Whereas a dense atmosphere preserves primitive isotopic compositions, a thin atmosphere on early Mars is severely influenced by stochastic impact events and following escape-induced fractionation. The onset of fractionation following the decrease in atmospheric pressure is explained by shorter timescales of isotopic fractionation under a lower atmospheric pressure. The comparison of our numerical results with the less fractionated N ({\$}{\^{}}15{\$}N/{\$}{\^{}}14{\$}N) and Ar ({\$}{\^{}}38{\$}Ar/{\$}{\^{}}36{\$}Ar) isotope compositions of the ancient atmosphere recorded in the Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001 provides a lower limit of the atmospheric pressure in 4 Ga to preserve the primitive isotopic compositions. We conclude that the atmospheric pressure was higher than approximately 0.5 bar at 4 Ga.},

abstract = {The transit spectrum of the exoplanet HD 189733b has recently been obtained between 0.55 and 1.05 microns. Here we present an analysis of this spectrum. We develop first-order equations to interpret absorption spectra. In the case of HD 189733b, we show that the observed slope of the absorption as a function of wavelength is characteristic of extinction proportional to the inverse of the fourth power of the wavelength (lambda{\^{}}-4). Assuming an extinction dominated by Rayleigh scattering, we derive an atmospheric temperature of 1340+/-150 K. If molecular hydrogen is responsible for the Rayleigh scattering, the atmospheric pressure at the planetary characteristic radius of 0.1564 stellar radius must be 410+/-30 mbar. However the preferred scenario is scattering by condensate particles. Using the Mie approximation, we find that the particles must have a low value for the imaginary part of the refraction index. We identify MgSiO3 as a possible abundant condensate whose particle size must be between 0.01 and 0.1 microns. For this condensate, assuming solar abundance, the pressure at 0.1564 stellar radius is found to be between a few microbars and few millibars, and the temperature is found to be in the range 1340-1540 K, and both depend on the particle size.},

abstract = {t is important in astronomy and cosmology to accurately describe the shapes of many objects. Telescope images are distorted by the point spread function, which is produced by many physical sources. A new model is needed to describe the point spread function variations on shorter scales than the distance between stars. Principal Component Analysis is a method whereby a large collection of images can create its own global solution based on the point spread function of the stars contained therein. A convenient way to describe each star is by representing them with shapelets, or localized, orthogonal basis functions. Shapelets are capable of accurately modeling stars with relatively few components. This research shows how models that describe individual images can be combined to create a global PSF pattern that describes all images in the set.},

abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

abstract = {We report here the first infrared spectrum of the hot-Jupiter XO-1b. The observations were obtained with the NICMOS instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope during a primary eclipse of the XO-1 system. Near photon-noise-limited spectroscopy between 1.2 and 1.8 mu m allows us to determine the main composition of this hot-Jupiter's planetary atmosphere with good precision. This is the third hot-Jupiter's atmosphere for which spectroscopic data are available in the near-IR. The spectrum shows the presence of water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2), and suggests the possible presence of carbon monoxide (CO). We show that the published IRAC secondary transit emission photometric data are compatible with the atmospheric composition at the terminator determined from the NICMOS spectrum, with a range of possible mixing ratios and thermal profiles; additional emission spectroscopy data are needed to reduce the degeneracy of the possible solutions. Finally, we note the similarity between the 1.2-1.8 mu m transmission spectra of XO-1b and HD 209458b, suggesting that in addition to having similar stellar/orbital and planetary parameters the two systems may also have a similar exoplanetary atmospheric composition.},

The HeI lines at {\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}4026, 4388, and 4471A were analyzed in order to define a calibration of the synthetic HeI full-widths at half maximum versus stellar vsini. A grid of synthetic spectra of HeI line profiles was calculated in non-LTE using an extensive helium model atom and updated atomic data. The vsini's for all stars were derived using the He I FWHM calibrations but also, for those target stars with relatively sharp lines, vsini values were obtained from best fit synthetic spectra of up to 40 lines of CII, NII, OII, AlIII, MgII, SiIII, and SIII. This calibration is a useful and efficient tool for estimating the projected rotational velocities of O9-B5 main-sequence stars. The distribution of vsini for an unbiased sample of early B stars in the unbound association Cep OB2 is consistent with the distribution reported elsewhere for other unbound associations.},

abstract = {This paper continues a series in which we predict the main observable characteristics of exoplanets based on their formation. In Paper I we described our global planet formation and evolution model. In Paper II we studied the planetary mass-radius relationship. Here we present an extensive study of the statistics of planetary luminosities during both formation and evolution. Our results can be compared with individual directly imaged (proto)planets as well as statistical results from surveys. We calculated three synthetic planet populations assuming different efficiencies of the accretional heating by gas and planetesimals. We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary mass-luminosity relation. We study the shock and internal luminosity during formation. We predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus entropy "tuning fork" diagram. We find high nominal post-formation luminosities for hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation histories can still lead to a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass. However, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the post-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of magnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot states. As a key result we predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep increase towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of low-mass planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an estimate of the planet mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the gas accretion rate can be estimated. Due to the "core-mass effect" planets that underwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies. Once the number of directly imaged exoplanets with known ages and luminosities increases, the observed distributions may be compared with our predictions.},

abstract = {Since the first report of a potentially non-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in its dayside atmosphere, the highly irradiated exoplanet WASP-12b has been under intense scrutiny and the subject of many follow-up observations. Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar binary companions {\~{}}1'' from WASP-12 has obfuscated interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free H2 atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH) for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b from HST/WFC3 and broadband transit photometry from Warm Spitzer. We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3 data to either H2O or CH4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere, respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis of WASP-12b suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870 ± 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.},

We apply these results to the Hubble Space Telescope observations of HD 209458, showing that the ratio of the planetary to stellar radii is 0.1207+/-0.0003. These formulae give a fast and accurate means of computing light curves using limb-darkening coefficients from model atmospheres that should aid in the detection, simulation, and parameter fitting of planetary transits.},
